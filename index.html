                <h1>COVID-19: What is Plasma therapy?</h1>
                <p>Plasma therapy, broadly known as 'convalescent plasma therapy', is a procedure to treat coronavirus infection. Plasma is a component of our blood. Nearly 55% of your blood is plasma. It is yellow in colour. Laboratories can separate plasma from blood with special devices called plasma tubes through a process called centrifugation. It is like blood donation, however, the same plasma gets separated from the blood and the remaining blood will be transferred back to your body resulting in zero blood loss. The plasma contains that antibodies that can help a patient fight the pathogen and recover from the disease.

                    When your body has fought an infection, the antibodies produced are stored in the plasma. That means if you’ve contracted COVID, then antibodies that can fight the COVID infection will be present in your plasma. The plasma from a person who has recovered from a disease is called convalescent plasma.</p>

                 <h1>Treating COVID-19 with donated plasma</h1>
                 <p>One early pilot study conducted in China evaluated the impact of convalescent plasma in ten patients who had been hospitalized with severe COVID-19. The study found that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were significantly reduced in all patients, with fever, breathlessness, cough, and chest pain especially improved. Inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein also appeared reduced after transfusion.

                            As in earlier studies, better results were observed in those who received plasma with higher antibody levels within 14 days of infection. Overall, the group showed a much-improved health status when compared to a recent historic control group. No serious adverse events were reported following transfusion in the plasma therapy group. The authors concluded that plasma therapy could offer a low-risk therapeutic treatment option but conceded that more rigorous, randomized controlled studies were needed.
                            
                            Subsequently, several observational case studies were published and reported associations between convalescent plasma and reduced viral load, improvement in clinical symptoms and reduced mortality.</p>

                <h1>Guidelines issued by the Centre to donate plasma to COVID-19 patients are as follows:</h1>
                <p> ➤  Always carry a hard copy of the COVID-19 negative report (RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) within 4 months of the day of donation and your Aadhar Card (front and back).</p>

                <p> ➤  Donate only after 14 days of a COVID-19 positive report if the person is asymptomatic or after 14 days of symptoms if the person is symptomatic.</p>
                    
                <p> ➤  Women who have ever been pregnant cannot donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma.</p>
                    
                <p> ➤  A person who has received COVID-19 vaccination will not be able to donate plasma for 28 days from the date of vaccination.</p>
                    
                <p> ➤  A person can not donate if he/she gets rejected for the lack of adequate antibodies in the blood.</p>
                    
                <p> ➤  Please contact hospital authorities for any other information in advance, on phone.</p>
